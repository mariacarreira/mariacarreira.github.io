Hi! I am a PhD Candidate at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the Department of Biology. I am advised by Joey Davis and am interested in the applications of deep learning to structural biology, particularly single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). I obtained my BSc in Biochemistry from University College London (UCL).
